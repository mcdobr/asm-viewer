# asm_viewer

This is the project i made for my Internet Technologies course. It is a primitive clone of the popular Compiler Explorer ( godbolt.org ).
You write C code on the left text area and select a compiler. You can see the assembler instructions the compiler has reduced your code to. You can compare the way different architectures do the same thing.
